      <!-- ABOUT -->
      <div id="about" class="lead">
        <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">We are currently finishing the datasets, evaluation metrics and submission system. Please follow us on Twitter to get updates: <a href="https://twitter.com/recsyschallenge">@recsyschallenge</a></div>
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          The ACM RecSys Challenge 2017 is focussing on the problem of job recommendations on <a href="https://www.xing.com/">XING</a> in a cold-start scenario. The challenge will consists of two phases: 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>offline evaluation:</strong> fixed historic dataset and fixed targets for which recommendations/solutions need to be computed/submitted.</li>
          <li><strong>online evaluation:</strong> dynamically changing targets, recommendations submitted by teams will actually be rolled out in <a href="https://www.xing.com/">XING</a>'s live system.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Both phases aim on the following task: </p>
        
        <blockquote> 
          <strong>Task:</strong> given a new job posting p, the goal is to identify those users that (a) may be interested in receiving the job posting as a push recommendation and (b) that are also appropriate candidates for the given job. 
          </blockquote>

        <p>For both offline and online evaluation, the same evaluation metrics and the same types of data sets will be used. The offline evaluation is essentially used as an entry gate to the online evaluation: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the top 20 teams (which also pass a XING baseline) will be allowed to participate in the online evaluation. </li>
          <li>Winner of RecSys Challenge 2017 = Winner of the online challenge</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="scenario" class="lead">
        <h2>Recommendation Scenario</h2>
        <p>Both offline and online evaluation focus on a <i>push recommendation scenario</i> in which new items (job postings) are given and users need to be identified...</p>

        <ol> 
          <li>who are interested in job postings in general (e.g. open to new job offers, willing to change their job)</li>
          <li>who are interested in the particular job posting which they are notified about</li>
          <li>who are an appropriate candidate for the given job posting (e.g. recruiters who own the job postings indicate that they are interested in the candidate)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Those users will receive the new job posting as push recommendation. In particular, the push recommendations are rolled out via the XING platform as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input:</strong> Job posting <code>p1</code> is given. This posting <code>p1</code> is a new item that just came on the platform and did not receive any clicks yet.</li>
          <li><strong>Computing recommendations:</strong> Given <code>p1</code>, the recommender computes a list such as <code>(u42, 0.8), (u23, 0.7), ...</code> Those <code>(user_id, score)</code>-tuples describe...
            <ul>
              <li>ID of the user (e.g. <code>u42</code>)</li>
              <li>a relevance score (e.g. <code>0.8</code>) which should reflect two aspects: 
                <ol>
                  <li><i>interest of the user in the job:</i> to what extent is the user interested in the job posting?</li>
                  <li><i>interest of a recruiter in the candidate:</i> how good does the candidate match the job, i.e. would a recruiter be interested in the candidate?</li>
                </ol>
              The score will be used for sorting and serves two purposes: 
                <ul>
                  <li><i>sorting job postings for a given user</i>, e.g.: if there are four postings which may be of interest, but XING would like to send only two postings as push recommendations to the user then one it will use the score to select the two top job recommendations for the user)</li>
                  <li><i>sorting the candidates:</i> this is, for example, required when candidate recommendations are shown to a recruiter. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Channels:</strong> given the list of recommendations such as <code>(p1, u42, 0.8), (p1, u23, 0.7), ...</code>, the recommendations are delivered to users through the following channels:
            <ul>
              <li><i>activity stream:</i> "Vacancies matching your profile" story in the stream on <a href="https://xing.com">xing.com</a> and in the mobile apps. (see <a href="./images/screenshot-activity-stream.png" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="multiimages" data-title="Job recommendation pushed into the activity stream of a user">screenshot</a>)</li>
              <li><i>jobs marketplace:</i> an orange notification bubble in the side-bar and an orange label "new" highlights the new job recommendation, e.g. on xing.com/jobs or in the mobile apps (see: <a href="./images/screenshot-jobs-marketplace.png" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="multiimages" data-title="Notifications about new job recommendations on xing.com/jobs">screenshot</a>)</li>
              <li><i>emails:</i> if the user did not see the push recommendation then the user may receive an email that points him/her to the job recommendation (see <a href="./images/screenshot-email.png" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="multiimages" data-title="Pushed job recommendations in emails">screenshot</a>)</li>
              <li><i>recruiter tools:</i> users which receive a job posting as push recommendation are also likely to appear as candidate recommendations to recruiters, for example, in the so-called <a href="https://www.xing.com/xtm">XING talent manager</a> (see <a href="./images/screenshot-xtm.png" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="multiimages" data-title="Candidate recommendations in XTM">screenshot</a>)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      

      <div id="challenges" class="lead">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Some challenges that the participating teams will need to solve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Balancing user interest and recruiter demands:</strong> In contrast to <a href="http://2016.recsyschallenge.com/">last year's challenge</a> which was solely focusing on estimating how relevant a job is for a given user, this year we will focus on both: Job recommendations should be relevant to the users and at the same time the users who receive those job recommendations also need to be appropriate candidates for the given job (e.g. the fact whether a user received interest from a given recruiter is part of the evaluation measure). </li>
          <li><strong>Balancing relevance and revenue:</strong> Some of the content is paid and some users pay for subscriptions. Teams will need to balance between relevance of recommendations and monetary aspects (i.e. the money that is earned with the recommendation). </li>
          <li><strong>Novelty / sparsity:</strong> recommendations need to be computed particularly for newly created job postings (those postings have not received any interaction). </li>
          <li><strong>Smart targeting of push recommendations:</strong> also, teams will need to estimate how likely it is that a user is actually interested in job recommendations, e.g. users that are not interested in job recommendations may delete recommendations or disable push recommendation notifications in case they receive too many (the latter is primarily relevant for teams that participate in the online challenge).</li>

      </div>

      <div id="evaluation" class="lead">
        <h2>Evaluation Metrics</h2>
        <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">To be finalized. Current plan below:</div>
        <p>Given a list of target items <code>targetItems</code>, for which the recommender selects those users to whom <code>item in T</code>, is pushed as recommendation, we compute the the leaderboard score as follows:</p>

        <pre>score(targetItems) = targetItems.map(item => score(item, recommendations(item))).sum</pre>

        <p>Here, <code>recommendations(item)</code> specifies the list of users who will receive the given item as push recommendation. The function <code>score(item, users)</code> is defined as follows:</p>

<pre>score(item, users) = 
  users.map(u => userSuccess(item,u)).sum + itemSuccess(item, users)
  
  userSucess(item, user) = 
    (
        if (clicked) 1 else 0 
      + if (bookmarked || replied) 5 else 0 
      + if (recruiter interest) 20 else 0 
      - if (delete only) 10 else 0 
    ) * premiumBoost(user)

  premiumBoost(user) = if (user.isPremium) 2 else 1 
      
  itemSuccess(item, users) = 
    if (users.filter(u => success(item, u) > 0).size > 1) {
      if (item.isPaid) 50
      else 25
    } else 0 
</pre>
  <p>Meaning:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>score(item, users)</code> sums up the success rates of the users and the item-based success rate.</li>
    <li><code>userSucess(item, user)</code> scores a user-item pair based on the interactions between those items:
      <ul>
        <li>clicks: user clicked on the pushed recommendation (1 point)</li>
        <li>bookmarks/replies: the user bookmarked the item or clicked on the reply button (which guides the user to the application form of the job posting) (5 points)</li>
        <li>recruiter interest: some recruiter showed interest into the user (e.g. clicked on the profile) for the given job item (20 points)</li>
        <li>deletes: in case we solely observed that the user delted the item (no click, no bookmark/reply, no recruiter interest), we count the pushed recommendation as negative feedback (-10 points)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>premiumBoost(user)</code> userSuccess scores count double points for premium users.</li>
    <li><code>itemSuccess(item, users)</code> if at least one successful push recommendation was created for a given item then this counts 50 points for paid items and 25 for other items.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Purpose of evaluation metrics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>both user satisfaction and the success from an item (aka recruiter) perspective is taken into account</li>
    <li>satisfied (and dissatisfied) premium users have a stronger impact than basic users.</li>
    <li>paid content is promoted compared to non-paid content</li>
  </ul>
      </div>

      <div id="dataset" class="lead">
        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>
          In the challenge, the task of the participants will be the following: given a XING user, the recommender should predict those job postings (items) that the user will interact with in the next week.
          The traing dataset is supposed to be used for experimenting and training your models. You can split the 
          interaction data into training and test data. For example: you can leave out the last 
          complete week (of the year) from the interaction data and then try to predict whether 
          a given user will _positively_ interact with an item within that week. Relevant items 
          are those items on which a user clicked, bookmarked or replied (`interaction_type` = 1, 2 or 3). 
        </p>
        <h3> Anonymization, pseudonymization, noise </h3>
        <p>
          The traing dataset is a semi-synthetic sample of XING's dataset, i.e. it is not complete and enriched with 
          noise in order anonymize the data. For example: 
          <ul>
            <li> the dataset contains artifical users </li>
            <li> the dataset contains only a fraction of XING users and job postings </li>
            <li> IDs are used instead of raw text for almost all attribute values (pseudonymization) </li>
            <li> some attributes of the users may have been removed or flipped to <i>NULL / unknown</i>. </li>
            <li> not all interactions of a user are contained in the dataset </li>
            <li> some of the interactions are artificial (= have actually not been performed by the user) </li>
            <li> timestamps have been shifted (but the order of interactions is kept) </li>
          </ul>
          Attempting to identify users or to reveal any private information about the users or information about 
          the business from which the data is coming from is strictly forbidden (cf. [Rules](http://2016.recsyschallenge.com/)).
          </p>

          <h3> Interactions </h3>
          <p>
          Interactions are all transactions between a user and an item including
          recruiter interest as well as impressions.
          Fields: 
          <ul>
            <li> `user_id` ID of the user who performed the interaction (points to `users.id`) </li>
            <li> `item_id` ID of the item on which the interaction was performed (points to `items.id`) </li>
            <li> `created_at` a unix time stamp timestamp representing the time when the interaction got created </li>
            <li> `interaction_type` the type of interaction that was performed on the item: <ul>
                <li> 0 = <b>XING showed this item to a user (= impression)</b> </li>
                <li> 1 = the user clicked on the item </li>
                <li> 2 = the user bookmarked the item on XING </li>
                <li> 3 = the user clicked on the _reply button_ or _application form button_ that is shown on some job postings</li>
                <li> 4 = the user deleted a recommendation from his/her list of recommendation (clicking on "x") which has the effect that the recommendation will no longer been shown to the user and that a new recommendation item will be loaded and displayed to the user </li>
                <li> 5 = <b>a recruiter from the items company showed interest into the user.</b> (e.g. clicked on the profile)</li>
              </ul></li>
